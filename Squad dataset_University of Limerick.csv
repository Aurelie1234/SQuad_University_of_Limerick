130,GEOMETRIC_COMPUTER_VISION,"Module Code - Title: CE5002 - GEOMETRIC COMPUTER VISION Prerequisite Modules: Rationale and Purpose of the Module:
Humans perceive a lot of information about the three-dimensional structure in their environment by moving around it. When the observer moves, objects around them move different amounts depending on their distance from the observer. This is known as motion parallax, and from this depth information can be used to generate an accurate 3D representation of the world around them.
In computer vision, we replicate this through geometric processing. Geometry is used to describe the structure and shape of the environment in which a camera is located. Geometric computer vision is, therefore, the process of determining the structure of the environment, and the position and orientation of the camera, and how the camera moves, with respect to the environment, through the analysis of camera image streams. It is commonly used in mobile robotics, vehicle autonomy and augmented reality. The module builds upon the machine vision modules already taught in the ECE department and complements the modules that teach semantic reasoning through machine learning. This module will be offered on the newly proposed part-time PPD in Computer Vision Systems (ID: 1681). In future, the module will be offered on a Part MEng in Intelligent Visual System and a Part MEng in Cognitive Robotics.Syllabus: Recap of Linear Algebra: Projective Geometry and Homogenous Coordinates Feature/point Correspondences Camera models and image formation Applications of Multiple View Geometry - Automotive, Drone Flight, etc. Epipolar Geometry and the Essential Matrix Visual Odometry - Estimation and Properties of the Essential Matrix, 8-point algorithm, RANSAC 3D Reconstruction of the scene - Midpoint, Direct Linear, ""Optimal"" The uncalibrated camera case: Fundamental Matrix - generalization of the essential matrix, Euclidian/Metric/Affine/Projective reconstruction Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping Introduction to optimisation algorithms, e.g. Levenberg Marquardt Bundle Adjustment - multiple rays, multiple camera positions, builds from multiple view geometry Windowed bundle adjustment, global bundle adjustment Loop Closure - Bag of Words Stereo Vision",What is the code for the geometric computer vision module?,"{ ""text"": [ ""CE5002"" ], ""answer_start"": [ 21 ] }"

199,DIGITAL_TEST_AND_MEASUREMENT,"Learning Outcomes: Cognitive (Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Evaluation, Synthesis) On successful completion of this module, students will be able to: 1. Discuss how electronic circuits and systems are tested. 2. Examine failure mechanisms in electronic circuits and systems. 3. Describe how test programs are developed for digital Integrated Circuits (ICs). Affective (Attitudes and Values) On successful completion of this module, students will be able to: 1. Show the need for effective testing procedures and the impact of decisions on test quality and cost. 2. Acknowledge the need to develop high quality and cost-effective test procedures within an organization. 3. Discuss how real-world non-ideal electronic circuit behavior will affect the test results obtained during test program operation. Psychomotor (Physical Skills) On successful completion of this module, students will be able to: 1. Test digital circuits using simulation models and physical prototypes. 2. Perform tests on a digital IC circuit design and analyze the results. 3. Deliver test results in a suitable manner. How the Module will be Taught and what will be the Learning Experiences of the Students: This module is offered to practicing engineers working in digital Integrated Circuit (IC) test and test development activities. The module will be taught using a blended approach using on-campus face-to-face teaching and online using an appropriate Learning Management System (LMS). The module will be run outside the normal Central Scheduling System and will be based on an initial on-campus day in week 1, online activities in weeks 2 to 14, and a final on-campus day in week 15. The required laboratory equipment to undertake the module will be provided to the participants in week 1, and this equipment will be returned after a final project presentation in week 15. The module assessment will be based on the submission of weekly reports, a project with final report and demonstration, and an end of semester examination. The end of semester examination does not require a centrally scheduled examination as this will be in the form of a test that will be undertaken alongside project presentations and will be organized within the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering. Application to Graduate Attributes: Curious Through the range of learning activities, particularly the problem-solving laboratory and tutorial sessions, the participants would develop problem-solving skills when applying theory to practice. The presented problems would allow the participants to gain knowledge at an initial high level before developing in-depth understanding as presented problems are understood in more detail and overcome. Agile The participants would be working individually and in the main, through an online presence. As such, they would be responsible for developing independent learning portfolios which, when problem-solving, would require adaptation to the individually developed learning schedule and which would depend on the individual progress on a week-by-week basis. Courageous The participants would be working individually and in the main, through an online presence. This module would be undertaken alongside workplace commitments. Such an approach to learning would require the development of resilience in order to successfully undertake the module as well as tenaciousness in order to persist with the module requirements and successfully complete the module. Responsible As this is a CPD course for industry, the participants are employees of the companies that are sponsoring them. As such, they would naturally be responsible in their actions as the module is part of their company training programme.
Articulate The participants would be working on the module as well as undertaking their workplace commitments. This would require the development of strong intra-personal skills in order to successfully undertake and complete the module. In addition, during the online sessions, questions arising would be formulated and communicated via the Learning Management System (LMS) Chat function. This would require the formulation of questions that are clearly defined and which would be understood by the other participants in the online sessions.
